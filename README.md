# Digit Recognizer using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Description:
Developing a custom CNN model that contains customized convolutional layers, maxpooling, dropout and dense layers by hyperparameter tuning resulting the increase in accuracy.

#### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3**
2. **Neural Networks** 
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**

This project mainly focuses on developing a CNN model to recognize the digits between 0-9.
We are provided with train and test data and they are present in digit-recognizer.zip file.
